# London Cocktail Week Scraper :tropical_drink:

## Project Overview
This application scrapes a list of bars and their location, description and opening hours from the [London Cocktail Week](https://londoncocktailweek.com/) website, and saves this information to a data frame and creates a new csv. This is developed using Python, and makes use of Beautiful Soup and Pandas.
